## How to redo the results of sampling bias
The results of the **Sampling bias** part can be recreated by following the same workflow as described in the Asymmetry folder. First, run the Matlab script createMasterSamplingBias.m. Then run the xmls in the master folder to get the tree files. After, run createXmlStructCoalSamplingBias.m. This creates 3 xmls (parallel chains) for each of the 4 methods (ESCO, MASCO, LISCO and SISCO) and for each tree. The xmls are saved in the xmls folder. Running each xml using esco.jar will perform an MCMC inference to estimate the migration rates and coalescent rates. Plotting is then done in R using the script samplingBias.R which will save an eps figure to the folder text/figures/SamplingBias

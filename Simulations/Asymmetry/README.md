## How to recreate the results of Inference of rate asymmetries

To recreate the results of the **Inference of rate asymmetries** part in the results section, first, run the script createMasterAsymmetry.m in Matlab. This will create 2000 master xmls by using the Asymmetry_master.xml as a template. The xmls will be saved to the folder master. After running all the xmls, the folder will contain an additional 2000 tree files with the simulated trees (The simulation conditions are encoded in the files names). After, run the script createXmlStructCoalAsymmetry.m. This will create 2000 * 2(for LISCO and SISCO) * 3(number of parallel runs with different initial values) = 12000 xmls that can be run with the esco.jar. Running this amount of jobs is only feasible on an cluster. The log file outputs of those runs can then be saved to the logs folder. Plotting is then done in R by running the plotAsymmetry.R script, which will save an eps figure to the folder text/figures/Asymmetry

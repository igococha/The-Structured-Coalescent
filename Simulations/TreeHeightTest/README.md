## How to redo the sampling of trees
The results of the **Tree height distributions under the structured co-alescent and its approximations** part can be recreated by running the Matlab script createXmlTreeHeight.m. This will create xmls to run with MASTER, ESCO, MASCO, LISCO, SISCO and BASTA from the template.xml files. After running the files and saving the log files for ESCO, MASCO, LISCO, SISCO and BASTA and the .tree file for MASTER to the out folder, the results can be plotted in R. To do so run the R script treeHeightplot.R which will analyse and plot the results as well as create a figure in the folder text/figures/TreeHeightTest. The conditions under which sampling and simulation of trees are performed can be changed in the matlab script in the first couple of rows by changin the number of **lineages**, the coalescent rates under **coalrate**, the migration rates under **migrate** or the sampling times of the lineages under **samplingtimes**

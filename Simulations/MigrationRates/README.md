## How to redo the results of migration rates
The results of the **Estimation of migration rates** part can be recreated by following the same workflow as described in the Asymmetry folder. First, run the Matlabs script createMasterMigrationRates.m. Then run the xmls in the master folder to get the tree files. After, run createXmlStructCoalMigrationRates.m which will create one xml for each of the four methods (ESCO, MASCO, LISCO and SISCO) and for each tree. Running the xmls using the esco.jar will return log files from where the most likely migration rate given the true coalescent rate can be extracted. This analysis is performed using the ABCOperator java class (part of ESCO). This operator multiplies a parameter by a fixed value at every step. The EndCriterion (also in ESCO) logger will then terminate the run when the posterior becomes smaller than the most likely posterior minus a fixed value. This is done to dicrease the run time and justified by the here unimodal shape of the posterior vs. the migration rate. Plotting is then done in R using the script migrationRatesPlot.R which will save an eps figure to the folder text/figures/MigrationRates

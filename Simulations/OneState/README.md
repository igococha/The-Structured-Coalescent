## Sample tree heights with only one state
Here tree heights were sampled using different coalescent priors. The constant coalescent prior is the standard constant coalescent as implemented in BEAST2. Tree heights are then sampled under the constant unstructured coalescent, MASCO and SISCO with m=1. Since there is no migration, MASCO, SISCO and the constant coalescent should essentially describe the same probability distribution. If their implementation is correct, they therefor have to sample from the same distribution, i.e. the distribution of tree height should be exactly the same for the different methods (which they are).
